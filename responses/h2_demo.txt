LLM Response: Player Who Should Receive Additional Playing Time: Player L
Explanation (stats-only):
Player L shows an unusually strong combination of elite efficiency and high defensive impact despite relatively low total points:
•	Exceptional shooting efficiency: 0.667 sh% and 0.917 sog% — the highest among players with multiple goals.
•	Significant defensive value: 13 caused turnovers and 11 draw controls, which is comparable to top defensive contributors who play heavier minutes.
•	Balanced contribution profile: Produces on both offense and defense, indicating they make the most of limited opportunities.
