Player with the Greatest Breakthrough Potential: Player G
Why Player G?
Player G currently has modest scoring numbers (16G, 4A, 20 pts) and the lowest shooting percentages among the regular contributors (sh% = 0.348, sog% = 0.630). Normally that suggests inefficiency — but G also has one of the strongest underlying non-scoring performance profiles:
•	39 draw controls → extremely high possession impact
•	11 caused turnovers → defensive productivity top-tier
•	High volume shooter with low efficiency → players like this often show the biggest jumps when finishing improves
•	Already contributing across the field despite limited offensive output
This combination — strong athletic/possession metrics + inefficient shooting — typically signals untapped offensive upside. If Player G simply improves shot selection or finishing by even a small margin, their overall point production could spike dramatically.
In short: Player G is already creating opportunities and controlling possession at a high level. Cleaning up shooting efficiency gives them the clearest path to a major breakout next season.
